cd jupiter-router-explorer
```

2. Install dependencies
```bash

## How It Works

Jupiter Router Explorer leverages Jupiter's Quote API to fetch and visualize optimal routes between tokens. It then presents this data in an intuitive, interactive interface that allows users to:

1. Select input and output tokens
2. View potential routing paths through various liquidity pools
3. Compare efficiency metrics between different routes
4. Execute swaps directly through Jupiter's Swap API

## Architecture

- **Next.js**: React framework for the frontend
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling
- **ReactFlow**: For interactive route visualization
- **Jupiter API**: For route quotation and swap execution
- **Solana Web3.js**: For blockchain interaction

Built with ‚ù§Ô∏è for the Jupiter Ecosystem during Namaste Jupiverse - Hackathon.
